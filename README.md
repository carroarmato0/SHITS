# SHITS
SHitty Improvised Tap System

Toshaan asked me to quickly implement a system to scan barcodes of beers and keep track of the amount for the Cfgmgmtcamp social event.

This is how great things come to be.

## How it works
Simply logs the string which is being scanned to a log file with a timestamp and the string to make it easy for parsing.
Think about grep + wc.
The timestamp is useful for generating graphs so we have an idea what time people consume something the most ;)
